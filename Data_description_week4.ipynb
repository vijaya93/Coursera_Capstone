    "## Part 1: Problem Description\n",
    "There is a Mall Contractor who plans to build a huge shopping complex(mall) in either one of the boroughs of Toronto (Scarborough) or in the Bronx borough of New York City.He wishes that the mall should provide amenities,shopping environment and international fashion brands younger, more affluent consumers are seeking.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are six factors that affect a mall’s success: comfort, diversity, luxury, mall essence, entertainment and convenience.\n",
    "#### Comfort\n",
    "Modern mall design focuses on the consumer first, because uncomfortable consumers mean fewer footfalls and declining business. The Forward-thinking mall developer wants to develop a comprehensive amenities package for the furniture, area rugs and accessories in its  retail centres’ common areas. Large open areas with comfortable soft furniture and decorative touches transform a day at the mall into a relaxing, pleasurable experience. This contractor wants the mall to have all kinds of variety in its goods and products so that it will cater to a wide range of customers who have different income ranges,different interests,preferences and is bustling with people all the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Diversity\n",
    "\n",
    "Historically, shoppers seeking a specific product or category were forced to search the mall for their items – a tiring, frustrating experience. Malls today view diversity differently – not just a very wide variety of retailers, but a planned selection of retailers organized to provide convenient shopper access.\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be a one stop destination for:\n",
    "apparel(kids,adults,teenagers),shoes,electronics,Wide variety of Restaurants offering different kinds of cuisine like Italian,Indian,Thai,African\n",
    "Chinese,Korean,Mughlai,Mexican etc),Bar,Lounge, Bakery, Breakfast Spot, Brewery and Café with fresh and high-quality groceries,general entertainment like Skating Ring,Cinema theatres,gaming zones etc.Perfume shops,Branded and luxurious goods,Imported ice creams,Groceries and the like.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Luxury\n",
    "\n",
    "Newer malls strive to create a luxury hotel ambience for shoppers.He wants to provide creature comfort and a hospitality experience with the same kind of amenities we'd find at a fine resort. Social gathering areas and services like concierge and a VIP arrival area help create this resort ambience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mall Essence\n",
    "\n",
    "Mall essence is harder to define, but it boils down to branding the retail environment and the shopping experience. Consumers are seeking a shopping experience that makes them feel comfortable, encourages them to stay longer and, more importantly, persuades them to return. New malls can meet or exceed these needs and consumer expectations by creating iconic “shoppertainment” locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "He plans to craft a relaxed environment that allows consumers to take home a memorable experience – one that they want to experience again and again. And that includes almost every element of the mall – retailer selection, mall design, dining options and amenities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Entertainment\n",
    "\n",
    "Entertainment is one of the core elements and he plans to apply it to every aspect of the mall that encourages shopper enjoyment. Areas for local community celebrations and festivals, among them an outdoor plaza, amphitheatre, and outdoor food court terrace — are all planned as social gathering places.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example-Mall Plaza Egana Mall dining areas are another essential feature of 21st century malls, and should be more than just “fuelling areas.” Plaza Egaña in Santiago, Chile, has restaurants on the roof of the mall that offer great views and open space. Together with a multi-screen cinema, an IMAX theatre, a food court and a jazz club, they help create a powerful entertainment destination.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convenience\n",
    "\n",
    "Convenience covers a number of aspects of mall design. Is the facility close to public transportation, and can that be incorporated into the design, as Plaza Egaña has? Is sufficient parking available to accommodate a busy shopping day? Does that parking area support multiple entry points to avoid crowding and congestion? Does the array of retailers match the needs of local shoppers?\n",
    "The contractor wants to observe multicultural cities like New York City and Toronto and wants to know whether the customers will be flocking to his mall.He wants to use segmentation and clustering to have a concrete idea about brand preferences, income ranges ,customer satisfaction  etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Data Analytics we often have very large data (many observations - “rows in a flat file”), which are however similar to each other hence we may want to organize them in a few clusters with similar observations within each cluster. For example, in the case of customer data, even though we may have data from millions of customers, these customers may only belong to a few segments: customers are similar within each segment but different across segments. We may often want to analyze each segment separately, as they may behave differently (e.g. different market segments may have different product preferences and behavioral patterns).\n",
    " \n",
    "The Mall contractor will observe the common venues in both cities,will gauge how similar or dissimilar people are with respect to their shopping destinations.He wants to build it  inside the borough, so is eager to earn more money and hence requires support  from customers and will also bring better \"Quality of Service\" to the old customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Mall is easily accessible to a wide range of customers, then the Services can be rendered on time.For example-For vegetables and other groceries to be fresh,they should be delivered to the restaurant in the right time and there would be no delay so the restaurant cooks can start their job from the morning and the Quality of Service will be high and this contractor will gain more reputation and income.\n",
    "\n",
    "The contractor should build this mall where it is closest to its customers in order to minimize the cost of transpotation in addition to the example above. which neighborhood (in that borough) would be a better choice for the contractor to build the mall in that neighborhood. Finding the right neighborhood is our mission and we will provide this contractor with a sorted list of neighborhoods in which the first element of the list will be the best suggested neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part 2: Data We Need\n",
    "1- We will need geo-locational information about that specific borough and the neighborhoods in that borough. We specifically and technically mean the latitude and longitude numbers of that borough. We assume that it is \"Scarborough\" in Toronto and Bronx in New York City. This is easily provided for us by the contractor, because the contractor has already made up his mind about the borough. The Postal Codes that fall into that borough (Scarborough) would also be sufficient fo us. I fact we will first find neighborhoods inside Scarborough by their corresponding Postal Codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- We will need data about different venues in different neighborhoods of that specific borough. In order to gain that information we will use \"Foursquare\" locational information. By locational information for each venue we mean basic and advanced information about that venue. For example there is a venue in one of the neighborhoods. As basic information, we can obtain its precise latitude and longitude and also its distance from the center of the neighborhood. But we are looking for advanced information such as the category of that venue and whether this venue is a popular one in its category or maybe the average price of the services of this venue. \n",
    "\n",

    "Some Notes about \"Foursquare\": https://foursquare.com/\n",
    "Foursquare is a local search-and-discovery service mobile app which provides search results for its users (Wikipedia).\n",
    "Founded: New York City, New York, U.S\n",
    "Users: 60 million\n",
    "Date launched: March 11, 2009\n",
    "Employees: Over 200\n",
    "\n",
    "Foursquare City Guide, commonly known as Foursquare, is a local search-and-discovery mobile app which provides search results for its users. The app provides personalized recommendations of places to go near a user's current location based on users' previous browsing history and check-in history.\n",
    "The service was created in late 2008 and launched in 2009 by Dennis Crowley and Naveen Selvadurai.It has the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "#### Local search and recommendations\n",
    "Foursquare lets users search for restaurants, nightlife spots, shops and other places of interest in their surrounding area. It is also possible to search other areas by entering the name of a remote location. The app displays personalized recommendations based on the time of day, displaying breakfast places in the morning, dinner places in the evening etc. Recommendations are personalized based on factors that include a user's check-in history, their \"Tastes\" and their venue ratings. \n",
    "#### Tips and expertise\n",
    "Foursquare eschews the traditional concept of letting users leave long-form reviews, and instead encourages the writing of \"Tips\" - short messages about a location that let other users know what is good (or bad) there. Tips are limited to 200 characters in length, but can include a URL to link to an external site with more information, and can include a photo. As a reward for leaving quality tips, a user can earn \"expertise\" in a particular location (e.g. a neighborhood or city) or category (e.g. Italian restaurants). \n",
    "#### Tastes\n",
    " \"Tastes\" let a user personalise their search experience.Foursquare has a defined list of \"tastes\" in particular food items, styles of cuisine or environmental aspects, which users may add to their profiles to let the app know what they like. The app uses natural language processing to match a user's tastes with the tips at nearby venues that mention them."
